What REST means
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful systems typically use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

What API means
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It defines a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

What CORS means
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious scripts from making unauthorized cross-origin requests.

What is an API
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact with each other.

What is a REST API
A REST API is an API that follows the principles of REST architecture. It typically uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform CRUD operations on resources.

What are other types of APIs
Other types of APIs include SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), GraphQL, and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) APIs.

HTTP Methods in RESTful APIs
GET: Used to retrieve resource(s) from a server.
POST: Used to create a new resource on the server.
PUT: Used to update an existing resource on the server.
DELETE: Used to delete a resource from the server.
How to request a REST API
To request a REST API, you typically use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE along with a URL endpoint that represents the resource you want to interact with. You also include additional parameters or data as required by the API.
